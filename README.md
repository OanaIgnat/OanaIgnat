### Hey, welcome 👋

:mortar_board: I am a PostDoc in the [LIT lab at University of Michigan](https://lit.eecs.umich.edu/), where I also completed my Ph.D. in Computer Science in August 2022.  

👯 I'm looking to colaborate on AI4Good :heart: applications, applying research in the real-world applications.

💬 My research lies mainly at the intersection of **Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing**,
I develop **Machine Learning models and Datasets** for **Human Action Understanding** and many other projects.

My main research projects have been on: 
- :nail_care: Human Action Understanding
- :bulb: Detecting Inspiration in Social Media
- :mag_right: Analysing OCR performance on Low-resource Languages for improving MT performance

🔭 I've worked as a Research Intern at Meta (FAIR) and Amazon (Prime Video).
