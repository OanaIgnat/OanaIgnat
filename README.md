### Hey, welcome ðŸ‘‹

:woman_teacher: I am a Tenure-Track Assistant Professor at [Santa Clara University CSE](https://www.scu.edu/engineering/academic-programs/department-of-computer-engineering/).

:mortar_board: I was a PostDoc in the [LIT lab at the University of Michigan](https://lit.eecs.umich.edu/), where I also completed my Ph.D. in Computer Science in August 2022.  

ðŸ‘¯ I'm looking to collaborate on AI4Good :heart:, applying research to real-world settings.

ðŸ’¬ My research lies mainly at the intersection of **Computer Vision** and **Natural Language Processing**.
I build **Machine Learning models** and **Datasets** for **Human Action Understanding** and many other projects.

My main research projects have been on: 
- :nail_care: Human Action Understanding
- :bulb: Detecting Inspiration in Social Media
- :mag_right: Analysing OCR performance on Low-resource Languages for improving MT performance

ðŸ”­ I've worked as a Research Intern at Meta (FAIR; x2) and Amazon (Prime Video).
